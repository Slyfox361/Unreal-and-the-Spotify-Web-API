# Unreal-and-the-Spotify-Web-API
this is a small demo integrating the Spotify Web API into unreal to help me develop my C++ skills and to help me learn about APIs

I am using this project to further my knowledge of C++ and Unreal engine for a university module on APIs. I'm using the Spotify API as it was the first thought i had when i heard APIs and i've always been interested in trying it out. (besides, i do enjoy music very fervently)
